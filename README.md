# Voice Changer

This is a Deep Learning based Voice Changer project. The final output of this project is hoped to be Neural Network architecture that can, to a reasonably high accuracy, 'convert' (for lack of a better word) speech from one voice into speech from another. This means the content of the speech remains the same, but the voice that speaks changes.
